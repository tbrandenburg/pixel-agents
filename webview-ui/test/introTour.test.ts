/**
 * Unit tests for the Intro tour's wire-facing state machine
 * (src/hooks/introTourState.ts) — the pure reducer useIntroTour drives.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A UNIT TEST, given "E2E over webview unit tests" (CLAUDE.md):
 * like greeter.test.ts, this covers DOMAIN invariants e2e can barely observe:
 * which asks survive being mooted, when a hooksStatus arrival is this tour's
 * install verdict and when it is noise, and what a revised choice resets.
 * Every one of them is a race with the server that a spec would have to
 * choreograph through timing; here each is one event applied to one state.
 *
 * Run with: npm test
