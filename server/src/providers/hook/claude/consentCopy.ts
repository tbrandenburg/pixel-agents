 * Disclosure text for the hooks consent gate, shared by both surfaces (the VS

 *
 * Two pieces, because a VS Code modal has two slots: the HEADLINE is the
 * message argument (rendered bold) and the DISCLOSURE is `detail` (the body).
 * The CLI joins them itself. Both surfaces must render both pieces — every
 * disclosure fact lives in one or the other, never in a surface's own copy.
 *
 * The event count is interpolated from CLAUDE_HOOK_EVENTS, never written out:
 * a hardcoded number silently becomes a lie the next time the list changes.

 *  store broadcasts (server/src/httpServer.ts). The claim was true for the

 *  the one thing that changes it, rather than making a promise the software can
